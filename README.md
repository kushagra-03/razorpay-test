To reproduce the issue I'm experiencing, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have valid Razorpay credentials and that all dependencies are installed.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Update Razorpay Keys**  
   Replace the placeholder values `RAZORPAY_KEY_HERE` and `RAZORPAY_SECRET_HERE` in the codebase with your valid Razorpay API keys.

2. **Run Setup**  
   Set up the application environment by running:
   ```bash
   bin/setup
   ```
   This command installs necessary dependencies, creates database configuration files, and prepares the app for development.

3. **Prepare the Database**  
   Drop any existing database, create a new one, and run the migrations using:
   ```bash
   rake db:drop db:create db:migrate
   ```
   This step ensures the database is fresh and all required tables are set up correctly.

4. **Start the Rails Server**  
   Launch the application server using:
   ```bash
   rails s
   ```
   The server should start and be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Visit the Application**  
   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

6. **Create a New Product**  
   Click on **"New Product"** in the navigation to access the product creation form.

7. **Submit the Product Form**  
   Fill in the necessary product details and click on **"Create New Product"**.

8. **Attempt to Pay with Razorpay**  
   Click on the **"Pay with Razorpay"** button to initiate the payment process.

9. **Observe the Issue**  
   Notice that the payment flow does not work as expected on the first attempt.

10. **Refresh the Page**  
    Manually refresh the page using your browser's refresh button or by pressing `F5`.

11. **Re-attempt the Payment**  
    Click on **"Pay with Razorpay"** again. This time, the payment process should work correctly.
